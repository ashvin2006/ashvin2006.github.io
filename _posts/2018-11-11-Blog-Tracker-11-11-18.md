    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To start understand how to use wires with a fuze box.</td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>We learnt by copying what was on the booklet and putting in the code. It was effective to multitask between the two of us, if one of us was putting in the code the other one would be building the circuit.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I accidentally didn't save the code before running it so I lost all of my progress.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Always remember to save my work. Not just on the fuze box but with everything I do on the computer.</td>
