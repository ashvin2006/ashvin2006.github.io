    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by reading information on github and information that the school had given to me. I helped the person sitting next to me and in return he helped me and this saved us oth plenty of time during the lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Because I haven't used github in months, I had forgotten how to change a background and had forgotten how to edit text like the title of the website, so this took me sometime to figure out.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will use the internet to help me solve problems and get ideas. This should give me more time to make changes to my website.</td>
