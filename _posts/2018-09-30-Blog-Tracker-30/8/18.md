    <td>I did the same as last week. That was using the booklet provided to and follow the instructions. Before putting in the code it is useful to read everything on the page as it helps you understand what the computer is doing.</td>

    <td>At the start of the lesson we wasted 10 minutes of our time trying to use our memory sticks and save our progress onto that. Even after ten minutes it wasn't working so we gave up on using the memory sticks and started coding.</td>

    <td>Next lesson we will just go straight into coding so that we donâ€™t lose any time for coding.</td>
