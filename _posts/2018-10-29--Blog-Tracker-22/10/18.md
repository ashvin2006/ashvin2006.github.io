    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by following the instructions shown on the booklet and by looking at the pictures and arranging the wires and lights in a similar way. I also experimented by moving the wires and lights up and down the board to see what would happen.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

    <td>My learning was limited because I didn't see what was going on in the picture carefully enough so my lights wouldn’t turn on.</td>
