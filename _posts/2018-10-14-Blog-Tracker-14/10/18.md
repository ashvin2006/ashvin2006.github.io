    <td>To continue learning BASIC.</td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by typing the code on the sheet and then trying to understand what every line of code means. This way I can try coding without the worksheet and make what I want to.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>One of the things that limited my learning was that my USB stick wasn't working and we wasted some time trying to use it. The other that limited my learning was that I couldnâ€™t type very fast so I think I need to try typing faster.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think I need to type faster and learn how to use my USB stick properly.</td>
