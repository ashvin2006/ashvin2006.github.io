  <tr>
    <td>The people we were sitting next to were making the robot move so we asked them how they did it and we then we did the same thing. We used the robotic arm to pick things up and move them which was fun.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> There was a way to make moving the robot a lot easier by just typing in numbers to make the robot do certain commands but we couldn't get that to work.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>Next time we will try the code again to see if we can get it to work.</td>
